# Json Counter 
Counts number of JSON objects

1. Clone the repo and `cd` into it
2. Run the script giving the example json file as argument (paste `ruby json_counter.rb example_payload.json` into your shell)
3. If that works fine, try your own JSON file. You will need to change the values (`response` and `venues`) in `json_counter.rb`
